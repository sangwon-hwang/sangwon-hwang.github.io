My name is Sangwon Hwang.
I am a full-time MSCS student.
Previously, I worked at InMobi, KETI (Korea Electronics Technology Institute).

Currently, my primary interest is financial modeling.
Previously, I've worked on probabilistic 
deep learning and generative modeling, particularly on using 
these models to improve predictive uncertainty and out-of-distribution behavior.

Please reach out to me at jakesangwon.h at gmail.
