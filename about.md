My name is Akihiro Matsukawa. Most people call me Aki.
I work at DE Shaw in NYC.
Previously, I worked at DeepMind, Google, and Twitter.
I'm also a part-time MSCS student at Stanford through the HCP program,
with a concentration in ML.

Currently, my primary interest is financial modeling.
Previously, I've worked on probabilistic 
deep learning and generative modeling, particularly on using 
these models to improve predictive uncertainty and out-of-distribution behavior, as well as specific
production applications such as text-to-speech (WaveNet).
