My name is Akihiro Matsukawa.
I'm a research engineer at DeepMind, working on the applied research team
in [DeepMind for Google](https://deepmind.com/applied/deepmind-google/).
I'm also a part-time MSCS student at Stanford with a concentration in
machine learning.

My research interests are primarily in probabilistic deep learning and
generative modeling. I'm particularly interested in applications of these models
to problems such as learning useful representations and
quantifying predictive uncertainty.
