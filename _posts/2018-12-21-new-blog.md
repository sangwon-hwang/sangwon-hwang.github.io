title:  "Starting a new blog (again)."
---

Hello world (again)! For the third time, I've decided I'm going to try to
start a blog and maintain a personal site of sorts.

The first time I tried, I had just started college and having a website was
just the cool thing to do, but I really
had nothing to write about. The second time, I had just graduated and started
work, and I thought it could be a nice motivator/forcing function to make me
learn new things outside of work, so I could write about them.
But turns out I didn't end up finding much time to learn
too many things, much less write about them.

But now I find myself actually constantly learning new things about machine
learning during my day job and as a part-time MSCS student at Stanford.
I expect this blog to be first and foremost for myself, to help me better
understand and through some ideas by organizing and presenting them as blog posts.
Hopefully that'll also be useful to readers along the way!

Either way, I wanted a place to collect links to my publications and such,
so this site will serve that purpose, even without the blog.

Hopefully third time is the charm! I'm cooking up an in-depth look at the
many forms of the ELBO in variational inference coming up for my first real
post, stay tuned!
